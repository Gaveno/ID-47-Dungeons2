##Version 2
The king was very pleased with the unique crystal our four friends had retrieved from that dungeon. It gave him prestige, respect and power. All the things a king wishes for, but his queen was ambitious. She wanted her king to expand his kingdom, conquer other kingdoms and become the most powerful man on earth.

The queen set out a reward for finding a new treasure, so people all over the kingdom started looking for new shine and glitter. She was convinced that if she could please her husband, he would finally listen to her ideas. But none of the treasure brought by the villagers could please the queen. She wanted something special, like the first crystal.

One day a villager came with the news of a second Crystal. It was described as a very special one, with powers not seen by man before. A crystal know by the ancient as the "magic star". The queen was exited by this news and set a new reward for retrieve this "magic star" from the dungeon in far forgotten place of the kingdom. But no one could fulfil her urging wish to posses this powerful crystal. The queen became inpatient by the people unable to beat the dangerous dungeon, no one had ever left alive and summoned the four, who had brought the first crystal.

The four had settled not far from each other in a quiet place in north of the kingdom and became good friends. The warrior and the Valkyrie even became lovers and had a beautiful daughter named Shajar. But when they heard about the queens summon, they all refused. This made the queen furious and she imprisoned our friends, but she didn't know about Shajar, who could escape before being noticed.

Shajar was devastated by the capture of her parents and their friends and didn't know what to do. In the woods she lived, an old woman told here about the powers of the second crystal. And with the help of some friends, the girl found a secret way to get close to the prison of her parents and she told them about her idea of getting the crystal, set them free and punish the queen for what she had done. Stubborn as she was, she neglected all the warnings about how dangerous the dungeons are. And just before she said goodbye to all of them, the wizard, who had been taken all his spells but one, was able to pass her his hidden ring for holding and casting spells. And so Shajar went on her journey into the dungeon, with nothing more than a ring, a scimitar and a feathered helmet.
